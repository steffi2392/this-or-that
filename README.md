This Or That App
Steffi Ostrowski, Spring 2012

This is an app designed for Nicole Miller's facebook page (It was live for a few months in spring 2012).  The app lets you choose between two items of NM clothing and then brings up a new item to compare against the one you chose.  You can also view the rankings that have resulting from all users - rankings are based on Elo rating system: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system

Reasons for App:
* Engage fans in the brand
* Research for NM by seeing what items score the best
* Practice Rails!
